This project implements an **ESP-MESH network** on ESP32 devices, enabling **wireless communication between nodes** while integrating a **web server** to control an LED remotely. It establishes **Wi-Fi connectivity**, manages **peer-to-peer data transfer**, and allows **real-time LED toggling via a web interface**.
